The code in this repository is the one used to perform the experiments in

[O. Junge, D. Matthes, B. Schmitzer: Entropic transfer operators, Nonlinearity, 37, 065004.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04901)

## 15.11.24 update

There is fresh implementation in the Julia language available at https://github.com/Xnartharax/EntropicTransferOperators-jl, including an additional example and an alternative solution of the optimal transport problem based on stochastic (average) gradient descent on the dual problem.
